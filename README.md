# Cyclist Weight Inference Research Project
This is the repository for the research project on inferring a cyclist's weight based only on the collected IMU sensor data. 
The research paper explaining all the details: [Cyclist Weight Inference using IMU Sensors on Bicycles](https://essay.utwente.nl/100958/1/Anghelus_BA_EEMCS.pdf)<br><br>

- The `Results` directory contains the obtained results for feature-based models, CNN and MLP models.
- The `Experiment_Models` contains some experimental models, not used for the final results.
- The feature-based models and deep-learning models are located in the respective directories. The final results were generated by changing parameters of these models. 
- The `Data` itself is not included due to confidentiality and big size.
